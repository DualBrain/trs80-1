This is a TRS-80 Model III emulator written in Go. It uses a web page for its
interface.  It can read diskettes and cassettes.

Install with:

    go get github.com/lkesteloot/trs80

Go to the source directory, which is probably:

    $GOPATH/src/github.com/lkesteloot/trs80

(If you have more than one item in your $GOPATH, use only the first one.)

Run with:

    ../../../../bin/trs80

Then go to this address with your web browser:

    http://localhost:8080/

and click the Boot button.
