    Make other-way web connection:
        Keyboard events.
        Start/stop CPU.
        Step, etc.
    Web interface:
        keys (for 08 and 09 above):
            // http://www.trs-80.com/trs80-zaps-internals.htm#keyboard13
            0 = @
            1 = A
            8 = H
            48 = enter
            56 = shift
    Keep the last few instructions (from log()) as unformatted lines, and print them
        after a panic.
    Replace NN and N in asm with real number.
    If going too fast, sleep for a bit.
        Make this cumulative so it corrects itself.
    Add Shift and Ctrl.
        Test Ctrl-0 (?) to use lower case input.
